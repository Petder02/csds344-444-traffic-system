# CSDS 344/444 Traffic Light System

Traffic light system project for CSDS 344/444

# Running the Application

First, make sure to install the necessary packages to run the traffic game simulation script.
This can be done by using the following command, which installs dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

After the requirements have been installed, the application can be run by executing the `traffic_system.py` script. 
This script can also be run with the following optional arguments to change certain aspects of the simulation:

`--red_time` - The amount of time for which the red light is on (default: 10 seconds)

`--yellow_time` - The amount of time for which the yellow light is on (default: 5 seconds)

`--green_time` - The amount of time for which the green light is on (default: 10 seconds)
